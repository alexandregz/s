# S Contributing Guidelines

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors to `s`:

1. When adding a `provider`: 
    1. Each provider should be a **single** commit.
    2. Add it to the README.md.
    3. Add it to `s.go`.
    4. Make sure providers in README.md and s.go are sorted alphabetically.
    5. Create a PR.
2. When doing refactors to the base code, make sure to discuss it in an issue prior to PR.
3. Use gofmt on all files.
4. Profit!
